# 💳 Credit Scoring & Loan Prediction

Welcome!  
In this project (`Credit_scoring_and_Loans.ipynb`), we dive into the world of **credit scoring** 🏦 and **loan approval predictions** 💰 — using machine learning to figure out who’s likely to repay their loans, and who’s a risk.

It’s a real-world application of data science with tons of practical value — and also a lot of fun to work on! 🔥

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration** 🔍
  - Deal with missing values and suspicious entries.
  - Explore key variables like Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, etc.

- **Feature Engineering** 🔧
  - Create new meaningful features (Debt-to-Income ratio? 🔥).
  - Encode categorical variables properly.

- **Model Building** 🛠️
  - Train classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
  - Try cross-validation to select the best model.
  - Tune hyperparameters for top-notch performance.

- **Prediction & Evaluation** 📊
  - Predict loan approvals.
  - Analyze model performance with metrics like Accuracy, ROC AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
